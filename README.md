# Digital-Twin
Uni Project on Digital Twin Modeling

# EV Range Simulation
-> Enabling Efficient EV Battery Development Through Digital Twin Simulation

# Goal
Simulate the range of an electric vehicle (EV) with various battery parameterisations and additional external factors.

# Background
Rapid EV adoption driven by sustainable transportation needs.

# Use Case
Developing new battery concepts is costly and time-intensive. This library therefore enables evaluation without physical prototypes. It additionally provides physics-based range estimation for new concepts.

# Limitations
- Simplified Environment
- Lossless motor model
- No energy recuperation (regenerative braking)
